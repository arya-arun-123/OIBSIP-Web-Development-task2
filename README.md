# OIBSIP-Web-Development-task1
This project provided me with hands-on experience in HTML and CSS, allowing me to understand how these technologies work together to create visually appealing and responsive web pages. By designing the layout, implementing color schemes, and arranging content sections such as the hero banner, gallery, rides, and contact sections, I was able to strengthen my front-end design skills and attention to detail. Working on this landing page also helped me learn how to structure content effectively, apply responsive design principles, and use interactive elements like buttons and hover effects, giving me confidence in building professional and user-friendly web interfaces.
