 This project provided me with hands-on experience using HTML and CSS, helping me understand how to structure and style responsive web pages effectively. By designing a clean user interface and organizing content thoughtfully, I strengthened my front-end development skills and improved my attention to detail. Working on this project also increased my confidence in writing clean, maintainable code and applying core web development concepts in a practical and meaningful way.
